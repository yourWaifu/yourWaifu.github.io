{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"3d-website","content":"<p>I made this website. It has 3D models, lighting, and materials. I used a ton of different tools to get this result. And in this video I’ll be going over how I used Blender, React, and Three js to make a sick looking website.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ii8PUGTwMpk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>First is getting an overview of how this website was created. I already have experience with webGL from making my own game engine and having to use webGL to render the game on a website. But I don’t feel like spending weeks on a renderer when there’s Three.js to do that stuff for me. There’s even a React Renderer made for it called React Three Fiber, that’ll help use Three.js with React.js.</p>\n<h2>Adding 3D Stuff</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/volumetric-light-w633u\"><img src=\"/images/3d-website/three-fiber-example_1.12.1.png\" alt=\"\"></a>\r\nI don't remember how I exactly got React Three Fiber working, but I remember using an example they had that rendered a 3D model. In that example, I noticed they used a GLTFLoader. GLTF is a royalty-free format for loading in models that 3D software like Blender supports, allowing us to use Blender for this project. Thankfully, someone also made a GLTF to React Three Fiber code generator that turned out to be really helpful as it would write out the code you would need to write to load and render the 3D models and materials that’s in the GLTF file.\r\n<a href=\"https://gltf.pmnd.rs/\"><img src=\"/images/3d-website/gltf-code-generator_1.19.1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>\r\nThey even have a nice website, <a href=\"https://gltf.pmnd.rs/\">https://gltf.pmnd.rs/</a>.</p>\n<h2>Making a 3D Model</h2>\n<p>However, before we can render a 3D model, we need a 3D model to render. Looking around in my hard drive, I found a flat 3D model of my name that I made years ago. I basically write my name in Krita, imported that into InkScape, exported that as a SVG and imported that to Blender, where I turned it into a 3D model and exported that into a GLTF.\r\n<a href=\"https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial\"><img src=\"/images/3d-website/three-basic-material_1.25.1.png\" alt=\"\"></a>\r\nThe 3D model doesn’t have a material or texture, so I used Three.js’s basic material, which just renders it as a solid color of my choice that wasn't effected by any lights.</p>\n<h2>The Camera</h2>\n<p>After that, I added some camera controls. When I first envisioned this, I thought of the camera following a 3D path that the camera will take. However, I felt that having the camera move forward was enough for the sake of time. I added an invisible HTML element that extended past the screen to make it so you can scroll down on the page, and made it so that scrolling down moves the camera.</p>\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/BeneficialAdorableGrison' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\nDoing this also makes the window where it draws all the 3D models also move up when you scroll down,\r\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/DizzyPleasingGreyhounddog' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n so I used some CSS to make it stay at the same spot on screen.\n<h2>Not a flat 3D Model</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/3d-website/PXL_20210404_2033386212.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nAt the time, I was buying a new keyboard so I decided to 3D model one for the website. I haven't touched blender in a while and they changed the interface since I last 3D modeled something in it. However, I just messed around with it and made some donuts before modeling the keyboard. I also went online to find some keyboard, and none of them were to my liking but I actually got to explore some 3D art on Sketchfab, and got a ton of inspiration.\r\n<a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/1984-apple-macintosh-128k-expanded-544a03b89d72462c9b1480dcae3d2530\"><img src=\"/images/3d-website/box-keycaps_1.44.1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>\r\nI saw someone modeled some old computer and the keyboard was just a bunch of boxes.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/keyboard-modeling.png\" alt=\"\">\r\nSo that’s what I did, I just made different sized boxe and made some of the sides smaller.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/computer-setup-proto.png\" alt=\"\">\r\nI also made a cup based off of low res cups I saw on Sketchfab. I didn’t stop there, I also made a computer, and a monitor.</p>\n<h2>HTML in 3D</h2>\n<p>I could have rendered text in webGL but doing so would remove a lot of browser features like text to speech, text select, and links. I would have to implement that stuff myself, there are libraries to do that but I felt that it would be quicker to get this site working using HTML text. I used Drei, which is like a library full of different stuff for React Three Fiber, I used it’s HTML overlay for where the text content will be. Drei’s HTML overlay also changes the size of the elements to make it look like they were part of the 3D content.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/translateZ-issues.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nBut when I first used it, it wouldn’t update the size of the elements for some reason unless I tell it to use CSS 3D translate, which created this really blurry text.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/scale-prototype.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nI didn’t like that and I couldn’t figure out what went wrong but I ended reading the code and recreating it into something that works for me. This solved the blurry text issue by having it not use CSS 3D translate and instead use CSS scale.</p>\n<h2>The Round One</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/3d-website/prototype_1.59.1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nAt this point, I deployed it and showed it off to some people online. I got a bunch of complaints about the cup being cursed. I think it's because the cup and the name had two different styles that didn't really match up together,\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/new-cup-vs-old-cup.png\" alt=\"\">\r\nso I decided to make a cup that was round.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/subdivisions_1.61.1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nI did some subdivisions on the model and added a few more faces on the top and bottom and it created this nice round model. However, this model had 2 million triangles. This model is going to be rendered on a slow phone so I need to lower that triangle count so that it doesn't cause my site to run so slowly.</p>\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SaneFloweryIrishredandwhitesetter' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\nBut lowering the number would make the cup less smooth looking. I know a trick that will work, and it is known as normal maps. It gives the illusion of a smoother model without more triangles. You can find more info online but I never did this ever before so I found tutorials online. Messed it up a bunch of times for hours and hours until I got a good result.\r\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/VariableRegalHoopoe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\nAnd there we have it, a name smooth cup without breaking the triangle budget.\n<h2>Different Surfaces One Material</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/3d-website/cpu-materal.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nI wanted to add another 3D model to the site, so I 3D modeled a CPU. The material on the CPU was the most complex part as a CPU is made up of more than one material. Some parts of it are made of metal, gold, etc.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/minecraft-rtx-texturing-guide/\"><img src=\"/images/3d-website/RoughnessMap-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a>\r\nI also never had to do this before, but I actually found a good guide on this for Minecraft textures. Minecraft’s new path tracing renderer for their bedrock version of the game adds in a albedo, metalness, roughness, emissive, height, and normal map to their game and they gave the community a good guide on how to use these for making texture packs. I’ve actually already known about this but I have never made those things before so I used this as a nice guide.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/blender-texture-painter_1.81.1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nI quickly got familiar with blender’s texture painter and uv editor so that I can paint new albedo, matel, rough, and specular maps.</p>\n<h2>99 Small Issues</h2>\n<p>From here, I fixed mostly small issues like I noticed some color banding,\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/trying-srgb_1.85.1.png\" alt=\"\">\r\nso I used SRGB and found the whole thing to have really washed out colors,\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/trying-dithering_1.87.1.png\" alt=\"\">\r\nso I tried dithering instead. I was afraid that might be noticeable but it fixed the issue and I couldn’t notice the dithering.</p>\n<p>I wasn't a fan of the scale bar because I felt that it was destroying the illusion of a 3D website. At first, I didn’t know how to do this and messed around with the HTML and css to get it not show a scale bar. It took me another day when I figured out a solution, once I did, I had to rewrite a good chunk of the HTML layout. However, thanks to React, the layout and the content was separated into separated components making this a lot easier.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/large-element_1.90.1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nI ended up making a large HTML element that you can scroll with the 3D content and using css, made the scroll bar off screen to the right and made it so that you can’t scroll to it. I then had to make the 3D content stick to the top and left sides of the screen using CSS sticky.</p>\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FalseAggravatingBorer' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\nHowever, CSS sticky elements take up space as such, it allows the user to scroll more than before.\n<p><img src=\"/images/3d-website/canvas-under-scroll_1.90.2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nThe solution I wanted was having the scroll element under the canvas and button.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/flex-to-the-right_1.91.1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nHowever, a simpler solution was to use css flex to move the scroll element to the right of the canvas where it should also be off-screen.</p>\n<p>Another problem was that is for some reason, I don’t know why, touching buttons outside of this big scrollable element, like the Home button, would cancel some inputs like scrolling. Making scrolling feel unresponsive.\r\n<img src=\"/images/3d-website/off-centered_1.95.1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\nI make this stick to the 3D content, but it would position itself a bit off screen for some reason. In fact, this made me notice that the 3D content was also a bit off centered now too. I tried fixing this with just CSS, but after a day and no progress, I realized that the whole site requires JavaScript anyway, so might as well do this positioning in JavaScript.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const viewportTop = topRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().top;\r\nconst viewportBottom = bottomRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().bottom;\r\nconst viewportCenterY = (viewportTop + viewportBottom) / 2;\r\nconst canvasRect = canvasContainer.current.getBoundingClientRect();\r\nconst canvasCenterY = (canvasRect.top + canvasRect.bottom) / 2;\r\nif (canvas.current.parentElement) {\r\n    const transformGoalY =  viewportCenterY - canvasCenterY;\r\n    if (transformGoalY !== canvasTransformY)\r\n        canvas.current.parentElement.style.top = `${transformGoalY}px`;\r\n    canvasTransformY = transformGoalY;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (backButtonRef.current.parentElement) {\r\n    const backBottom = canvasRect.bottom - viewportBottom;\r\n    if (backButtonBottom !== backBottom)\r\n        backButtonRef.current.parentElement.style.bottom = `${backBottom}px`;\r\n    backButtonBottom = backBottom;\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I calculated where the elements should be on screen and positioned the elements on every frame. And that fixed the strange issues and hides the scroll bar.</p>\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/HoarseGlaringAntbear' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\nI also noticed an issue where the Non-JavaScript content would flash on-screen before the 3D content would then flash on screen. I decided to make the Non-JavaScript content only visible when there’s no JavaScript content.\r\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/UltimateOffbeatAttwatersprairiechicken' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\nIf JavaScript is enabled, some text would fade in and when the first 3D model finished loading, it would fade out the text and fade in the 3D content.\n<h2>The Results</h2>\n<p>I showed it to people online and people were impressed. React.js, Three.js, and Blender, are all pretty good tools that can be used together to make some fun 3D websites. <a href=\"https://yourwaifu.dev/\">Check it out at yourWaifu.dev.</a></p>\n<h2>Thanks for Reading</h2>\n","layout":"article","title":"I made a 3D Website","description":null,"author":"Hao Qi Wu","date":"Wed Oct 06 2021 22:30:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)"}},"__N_SSG":true}
